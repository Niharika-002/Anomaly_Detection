**Introduction to Anomaly Detection**

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. In the context of time series data, anomalies can represent significant deviations from normal patterns, which could indicate potential issues, opportunities, or outliers.


**Understanding Time Series Data**

Before diving into anomaly detection techniques, it's crucial to grasp the characteristics of time series data. This section provides a comprehensive overview of time series data, including trends, seasonality, and common challenges in analyzing temporal patterns.


**Anomaly Detection Techniques**

Explore various anomaly detection methods tailored for time series data, such as statistical approaches, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid models. Gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each technique and understand when to apply them based on the nature of the time series data.


Statistical Methods

Z-Score Formula: The z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. It is calculated as:
z = (x - μ) / σ
Where:
z = z-score
x = individual data point
μ = mean of the dataset
σ = standard deviation of the dataset

Machine Learning Algorithms

Isolation Forest Algorithm: The isolation forest algorithm isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The number of splits required to isolate the data points is used as a measure of normality.

**Implementation Examples**

Get hands-on with practical examples and code snippets demonstrating how to implement anomaly detection for time series data using popular programming languages such as Python, R, and more. From simple threshold-based methods to advanced algorithms, discover how to apply these techniques to real-world datasets.
